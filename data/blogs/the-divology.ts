Maybe Django will do a better job than Node.js or Laravel? Nevertheless, there will be some must-have solutions that you‚Äôll have to encounter. Among them, there is HTML ‚Äì a markup language with which you‚Äôll build your app wireframe. If you dive deep into the HTML, you‚Äôll notice there are dozens of tags you can use. You may think: ‚ÄûWhat do I need all of them for? Can I use only one tag?‚Äù. Well, there are some reasons why it‚Äôs not an as good idea as it sounds. Today, we'll take a deeper look at one of these reasons - something that I use to call "the Divology".`

To be honest, it affects the results a lot. This happens because of the web crawlers that Google and other browsers use. Web crawlers are robots that browse the network and prepare the browser index. One of the factors they are concerned about is website construction. If a robot sees that you‚Äôre using only the div tag, it‚Äôll quickly get lost. As a result, the traffic on your website can get lower and lower. But, if a web crawler discovers that you use different header tags, text tags, and so on, it knows how to go through your website. Eventually, there is a chance your web app will be ranked higher in the google rankings ‚Äì and that‚Äôs what you want, don't you?`
