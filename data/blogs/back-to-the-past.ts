However, there is one exception to this rule. Although many coders have never written a single line of code in COBOL or FORTRAN, every computer science student has to deal with C language at some point in their studies. You may think that it’s not worth learning it. Well, that’s only partially true, because even though it’s hard to find a job in C, learning it can be helpful for you to understand more in programming. Want to know why? Let me explain it."

That’s also a good reason why choosing C as your first programming language is a good choice – its syntax is the most basic one you can ever imagine. With C, you’ll get used to using mentioned semicolons, but also basic instructions like if-else, switch statement and many others. Additionally, you can poorly find some advanced stuff. For example, there is no such thing as a vector in the C language. Hence, if you want to use it in C, you need to build it from scratch."

Secondly, it’ll broaden your knowledge when it comes to non-implemented topics. I’m sure if you used C++, you dealt at some point with vectors. But tell me, have you ever written a vector-like structure from scratch? Do you even know how does it work? As you can see, C can improve your knowledge in this context exactly because it's extremely minimalistic."

In the end, coders have to check before running their program if they prevented the risk of memory leaks and other errors. As they say – quid pro quo."
