With one of these languages, you‚Äôll be able to practice problem-solving. Where can you learn developing algorithms?

In the past, it was widely used, especially in finance IT. However, this language was created in 1959 and hasn‚Äôt been updated for decades now. Nowadays, no company thinks of starting a project from scratch with COBOL because there is no reason for using it.

If you don‚Äôt write in a specified language for a longer time, you‚Äôll struggle to write something only a bit advanced one day.
